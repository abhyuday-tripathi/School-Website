				<h4>New School Canteen</h4>
				<img src="shutterstock_1109442980.jpg">
				<p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
					My school is a very big one and it has a very modern canteen.
					It is perhaps the most popular place in the school.
					It becomes very busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.
					Our school canteen is very well equipped.
					One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc.
					They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm.
					There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.
					All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day.
					The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard.
					There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely.
					There is also a separate enclosure for teachers.
					The cook charges very reasonable rates from us.

				<h4>School Management Mobile Apps</h4>
				<img src="pricipalapp.png">
				<p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 ">
					This is a busy world and everybody’s always on the go, hence our mobile apps help in accessing information anywhere, anytime. Parents can easily stay updated with their ward’s performance, right from receiving notifications for home
					assignments to viewing their report cards. This further helps in improving the performance of their child. Teachers can share assignments and important information to the parents. The school management app can closely monitor and record all
					the necessary details such as student information, staff details, keep track of school system equipment, and a lot more to streamline the daily administrative jobs. The principal or the head of the school can view the entire functioning of
					the institute, right from classroom content to the payrolls of the entire staff.
